# CHIP8-Emulator
A CHIP-8 VM/interpreter written as a way to experiment with Cmake, QT and dabble into emulators

The emulator doesn't play sound, altho the relevant opcodes are there

### Input
Chip-8 programs can react to A-F and 0-9, For example, the brix and breakout keybindings are 4 and 6 for left and right.

1	2	3	C<br>
4	5	6	D<br>
7	8	9	E<br>
A	0	B	F<br>
